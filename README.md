<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This project was built on a Windows machine
The files and installs were accessed through Windows Terminal with GitBash applied to it
It was edited using Visual Studio code

My reccomendation would be to mimic that set up when working with this project

### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_rushayhays/NSSfrontendCapstoneMAG.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm i --save react-router-dom
   ```
   ```sh
   npm install react-minimal-pie-chart
   ```
4.I assume that cloning the repo down will automatically set it up as a react app
  If for some reason that is not the case, install this
  ```sh
  npx create-react-app
  ```
5.You will want to copy the .example database inside the api directory. When you have created the copy go ahead and remove the .example extension off of it.

This Home Page has room to grow. Clicking on the pie chart will direct you to the Food Storage Page
